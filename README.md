# Tableau.Airbnb_Dashboard
This project combines Airbnb listings and calendar datasets using an inner join and visualizes pricing and neighborhood patterns in Tableau. The dashboard explores price groups, average prices by beds and neighborhood, and review distribution.

Note: Please note that Tableau Desktop is required to open and interact with this dashboard

Second Note : In addition to the main dashboard, individual worksheets are kept visible. An extra worksheet (Reviews by Bathroom) is included for deeper exploration, even though it is not part of the final dashboard.
